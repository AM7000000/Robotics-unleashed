ComboFirmata contains the modified version of firmata for the LCD, Ultrasonic and DHT11 code. I have tested this on Arduino 1.6.5.
Config contains the required files and instructions on how to program the Bluetooth module.
 
Blocks.xml contains the modified blocks which allows the DHT11, LCD and Ultrasonic sensors to work at the same time.
(NOTE: The blocks supplied with the LCD/Ultrasound libraries in Snap will NOT work with the modified Firmata firmware.)
Sensor Docs contains basic instructions in the connection of the DHT11, Ultrasonic and LCD modules.

Please make sure you have uploaded the correct firmware and loaded the correct blocks if it doesn't work or only works partially.
